At the heart of Wireshape's value proposition is its unparalleled product transparency engine, the Token Curated Product Registry (TCPR), a decentralized cryptosystem of curation of product information, which creates a reliable database recorded on the blockchain and maintained by the community, which receives intrinsic incentives in WWIRE tokens as rewards. By embracing product data transparency, Wireshape empowers consumers with detailed, verifiable information about the products, fostering informed purchasing decisions and promoting transparency as a core value.

With PoA, transaction validation is conducted by approved validators, ensuring rapid processing times and reduced energy consumption compared to traditional Proof-of-Work systems.

#### Active Stakeholder Participation

This collaborative approach not only enhances the accuracy and richness of data but also cultivates a shared sense of responsibility and trust across the supply chain network.
