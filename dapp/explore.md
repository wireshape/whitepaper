In this paper you will learn how to check the product data registries on Wireshape blockchain, perform searches by product name, brand, feature or barcode, as well as apply search filters such as country and category.

Wireshape is the first open blockchain dedicated to the decentralization of product data, focused on providing structured data so that consumers can make informed purchase decisions, reducing the high rate of complaints and returns, especially in online purchases, where it is difficult to find the necessary information.

On the Wireshape dApp platform - [https://beta.wireshape.org](https://beta.wireshape.org/) - go to Explore in the main menu. On the Explore page - [https://beta.wireshape.org/explore](https://beta.wireshape.org/explore) - you will have free access to search for any product registry on the blockchain.

In the sidebar you will find the search filters by country of registration of the product, and category.

At the top right you can find the search field. You can search by category, for a product feature, by the brand or by a specific barcode.

When hovering over the product, you will see the Show Product button. Just click and you will have the complete data about the product.

Such as description, barcode, brand, product, country of origin and specific characteristics.

For example, under the Food and Beverages category, we have Net Content, Ingredients, Nutrition Facts, Observations, Allergen information, storage instructions and more.

We also have the type and material of the packaging, and an indication if it is recyclable. As well, product measurements and gross weight, fundamental data for logistics.

All of this data registered on the blockchain is also accessible through a complete and easy-to-integrate API.

If you are a representative of a supplier or retailer and would like to provide transparency for your customers by integrating the API, please contact the team.

On the product page, when you click Check on the Blockchain button, you are directed to the Block Explorer, where you can check all transaction data of the product registry on the Wireshape Blockchain.

All product data registries are added and curated by the community through the Token Curated Product Registry, a decentralized system developed by Wireshape of curation of product information, which creates a reliable database on the blockchain and rewards the community with intrinsic incentives in WIRE tokens.
