# Wireshape Protocol

## Introduction

Wireshape is building a public blockchain dedicated to decentralizing global product data, making it useful for consumers to have real, complete and relevant information about a product before it is purchased, ensuring greater satisfaction by acquiring what was really expected.

With Wireshape solution, we will create a decentralized product review system, registering on the blockchain based on a unique purchase transaction ID, through a purchase certificate NFT for each customer of e-commerces that use Wireshape.

Wireshape network helps make the transition from Web2 to Web3 and 2D graphics to immersive 3D, providing for brands and ecommerces easy-to-implement tools and APIs.
